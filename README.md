# Introduction
Computer software binary is a set of machine instructions that is non-human readable sequence of ones and zeros byte stream to instructs what operations the computer would perform. Without a proper program such as disassembler, it is almost impossible for us to interpret what the binary would do. Same situation applies when try to compare the content of different binaries functions for which they may be compiled with different compilers, built for different machine architectures, or coded with different implementations. In cyber security, the ability to compare or to understand the context of a piece of software is essential because most of the computer virus, malware or malicious computer binary fragment always conceals itself from a legit binary, especially for a zero-day attack. However, based on the difficulities memtioned, there is by far no esay or an effective way to search for a known hidden harmful binary fragment from a legit binary. To this end, *dyCd* is a binary clone detection tool, which based on the symbolic execution approcah to effectively detect a sementic clone for the given two binary functions.
