# Introduction
Computer software binary is a set of machine instruction that is non-human readable sequence of ones and zeros bytes stream. Without a proper program, it is almost impossible for us to interpret what the binary would do. Same situation applies when try to compare the content of two different binaries functions in which they may be compiled in different compilers, machine architectures, or different implementations. In cyber security, the ability to identify a computer virus, malware or piece of small malicious computer binary fragment from known harmful operations is essential to identify a threat before it would actually does harmful operations to our computer system, especially when trying to detect a zero-day attack. However, based on the difficulities memtioned, there is by-far no esay or an effective way to search for a known hidden harmful binary fragment from a legit binary. To this end, *dyCd* is a binary clone detection tool, which based on the symbolic execution engine to effectively detect a sementic clone for the given two binary functions.
